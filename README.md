Introduction. 

I ran into a little problem. My task was to record the application window through OBS Studio.
The program itself already has this function, but it has a significant drawback: while recording the window, it must always be active. And if we minimize the window, then OBS will stop recording!

My utility (Window Capture FIX) allows you to bypass this limitation.
